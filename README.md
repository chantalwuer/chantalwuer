### About me 👩🏻‍💻

Researcher on International Climate Policy at PBL - Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. 🌱 I moved from Germany to The Netherlands to study Earth Sciences - Global Environmental Change and Policy at the VU Amsterdam. After that, I participated in a Data Science Coding Bootcamp at Le Wagon Amsterdam and learned all about data analysis and machine learning with Python. Now at PBL I am working with Integrated Assessment Model output to create meaningful insights for climate policy-makers. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on international climate policy research
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python, Machine Learning, Spatial Analysis
- 💬 Always happy to connect with like-minded people and chat about sustainability and earth science related data
