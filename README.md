### About me 👩🏻‍💻

Aspiring data scientist with interest in sustainability. 🌱 I moved from Germany to The Netherlands to study Earth Sciences - Global Environmental Change and Policy at the VU Amsterdam. After that, I participated in a Data Science Coding Bootcamp at Le Wagon Amsterdam. Now I am looking for the next step in my career to use my skills to make a positive impact. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on an earthquake modeling project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Spatial Analysis
- 🤔 I’m looking for an opportunity that will let me combine data analytics with sustainability
- 💬 Always happy to connect with like-minded people and chat about sustainability and earth science related data
